							Thomas T. Daniel received a Ph.D. in Nanotechnology from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati, focusing on device fabrication for sensing applications. 
							Along with his Ph.D. advisor, Prof. Roy P. Paily from IIT Guwahati, Thomas co-founded K-FAB Tech Private Limited, a startup aimed at making semiconductor fabrication equipment more affordable for researchers. 
							His professional experiences include serving as Project Manager for cleanroom at the India Innovation Centre for Graphene (IICG) and providing technical consultancy to various academic and research institutions in establishing cutting-edge micro and nanofabrication facilities.
						</p>
						<p>
							During his doctoral studies, Thomas T. Daniel designed, modeled, fabricated, and characterized several devices to understand their electrical schemes. 
							The fabrication process involved using a wide range of materials, including semiconducting materials, magnetic materials, and magneto-semiconducting heterostructures. 
							He was involved in various stages of device fabrication, from additive micro-fabrication techniques to their characterization. 
							These experiences provided him with a comprehensive understanding of the electronic, optical, structural, and sensing properties demonstrated by these materials and devices.
						</p>
						
						<blockquote>
							Thomas's research primarily revolves around the fabrication and characterization of gas sensors, with a focus on their electrical and magnetic properties. 
							To achieve high-performance outcomes, he strategically modifies the device's current-voltage characteristics through interface engineering. 
							His research also delves into the thermionic emission phenomena in Schottky diodes, coupled with computational simulations, providing valuable insights into electron transport mechanisms, particularly in the context of semiconductor-metal interfaces.
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							Thomas's research responsibilities extensively involved wet and dry oxidation processes, thin film deposition, and boron/phosphorus diffusion techniques. 
							Wet and dry oxidation processes are essential for establishing crucial silicon dioxide (SiO$_2$) layers pivotal in device fabrication, ensuring the formation of high-quality SiO$_2$ layers vital for the functionality and reliability of microelectronic devices. 
							Additionally, silicon diffusion processes play a pivotal role in modulating the electrical properties of silicon, facilitating precise control over doping concentrations and carrier mobility within the silicon substrate. 
							These techniques collectively contribute to advancing semiconductor device fabrication and enhancing performance across various applications. 
							His research explores a diverse array of additive manufacturing and patterning technologies to fabricate a range of devices, including resistors, Schottky diodes, and field-effect transistors. 
							To overcome the challenges of fabricating the devices and performing sensing characterization, he developed specialized systems.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><h4>Controlled environmental chamber for gas sensor calibration</h4></li>
							<p>
								The system has been designed to blend various gases, utilizing mass flow controllers, at different concentrations ranging from parts per billion (ppb) to parts per million (ppm).
							</p> 						
							<li><h4>Micro fabrication-based printing technology</h4></li>
							<p>A novel working prototype is demonstrated for printing emerging electronic components and novel devices, thus offering a potential alternative to traditional microfabrication-based technologies in terms of cost, rapid fabrication and simplicity.
							</p>
						</ul>
						<p>
							These fabricated devices serve a crucial purpose in detecting various gases present in breath samples. 
							Among the targeted gases are Nitric oxide (NO), Oxygen (O$_2$), Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), Hydrogen (H$_2$), water vapor (H$_2$O), and traces of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). 
							Importantly, the sensitivity of these sensors extends to levels ranging from parts per million (ppm) to sub-parts per million (sub-ppm), making them highly effective for detecting even trace amounts of gases. 
							In essence, my doctoral research in sensor fabrication and characterization stands as a proof-of-concept for the continued development of healthcare technologies, providing possibilities for better patient care and diagnosis. 
							Furthermore, my experience in microfabrication-based printing technology has enabled the rapid fabrication of electronic components and novel devices, offering a potential alternative to traditional microfabrication-based 
							technologies in terms of cost, rapid fabrication, and simplicity.
						</p>
						<p>
							Following his doctoral studies, Thomas joined IICG as a project manager, overseeing cleanroom projects aimed at developing micro/nanoelectronics devices. 
							As a Promoter and Technology Officer Remote of K-FAB Tech, he mentors employees to innovate in semiconductor device fabrication, leveraging his startup experience to bridge academia and industry.
